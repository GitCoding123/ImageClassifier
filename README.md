# Image Classifier
This project is a game where two pictures, one of a jaguar and one of a leopard, appear. The user must choose which picture they believe is the jaguar. The selected picture will be processed through a ResNet50V2 machine learning model trained to distinguish between jaguars and leopards at 98% accuracy. See the report for further information.
